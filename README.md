# YARN IS LIFE
Code Institude First Portfolio Project HTML and CSS only

Yarn Is Life is a static website designed to introduce people to the art of crochet and invite them to join a crochet club. It was inspired by my daughter who loves to crochet.

## DESIGN

### Colour Choices
The colours were based on the colour palette of the hero image, which was sourced from istock [here](https://www.istockphoto.com/es/foto/fondo-de-pasatiempo-artesanal-con-hilo-en-colores-naturales-gm1349994486-426293103)
The remaining colours were picked from the hero image using the chrome extension [colorzilla](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp) and by reference to [coolors.co](coolors.co)

### Fonts
The main font of the site is xxx for accessibility.
The Yarn Is Life logo has been styled using BrittanySignature, from xxx

### Images
Images are sourced from [istock](https://www.istockphoto.com/) with the exception of the About Me picture and the Latest Projects images, which are property of Georgina Carey. xxx

## FEATURES

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is at the top of all pages. It consists of the Yarn Is Life logo and links to the Home, Club and Patterns pages.
The bar is designed to be one line, no collapse (no hamburger menu) regardless of screen size.

### Hero Image
The [hero image](https://www.istockphoto.com/es/foto/fondo-de-pasatiempo-artesanal-con-hilo-en-colores-naturales-gm1349994486-426293103) was chosen for its natural colours and inviting depiction of yarn for crochet. The blank space near the centre of the image was used as a canvas for the hero text.

### Contents

**Home page**

The user is greeted with the hero image and hero text saying welcome to the site. On smaller screens the About Me section is also visible. The home page also contains a Learn to Crochet section and a Latest Projects section.

![Home Page]()

**Club Page**

The club page includes locations and times of the crochet club meetups.
There is also a form to join the mailing list to be informed of future club events.

![Club page]()

**Patterns Page**

This page includes live links to patterns available on other crochet pages. Links open in a new tab.
Patterns are divided into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced sections for easy navigation.

### Footer

The footer contains icons for facebook, twitter xxx, youtube and instagram. The links open in a new tab.

### Potential Future Features

It would be nice to add a third UX feature: Frequent Visitor Objectives - be able to submit own projects to be featured on the site.
Work has begun on a "learn to crochet" page featuring original learn-to-crochet instructions and images, not linking to any external sites.

## UX

### First Time Visitor Objectives

* Instantly understand who and what the site is for
* Be able to navigate the site easily
* Be able to find information related to crochet

## Returning Visitor Objectives

* As first visitor objectives
* See new information (latest projects) immediately on visiting the site
* Be able to find up to date information about club meetings

## TESTING

### Fixed Bugs
Hero image failed to load on first try. Html <img> element had href attribute instead of src attribute - amended.
Latest projects section was unresponsive to screen size. Flexbox properties had been added to the wrong container div in html - fixed.
 
### Unfixed Bugs
None
